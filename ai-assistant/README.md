# Getting Started with AI-Assisted Development

## Overview

This provides a systematic approach to AI-assisted software development, focusing on:

- Modular, task-specific AI interactions
- Structured workflow management
- Comprehensive development guidance

## Core Principles

1. **Modularity**: Break down complex development tasks into manageable, focused interactions
2. **Systematic Approach**: Use structured workflows to guide development
3. **Flexibility**: Adapt to different project types and development stages
4. **Continuous Validation**: Verify outputs at each stage of development

## Development Workflow Strategies

### Key Workflow Components

- Prompt-driven interactions
- Step-by-step development processes
- Continuous integration of AI assistance

### Workflow Characteristics

- Technology-agnostic approach
- Emphasis on incremental development
- Clear verification points
- Adaptable to different project contexts

## Best Practices

1. **Granular Interactions**: Break tasks into atomic, manageable steps
2. **Contextual Awareness**: Maintain comprehensive project context
3. **Iterative Validation**: Verify and validate at each development stage
4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear, comprehensive documentation
5. **Flexibility**: Adapt workflows to project-specific needs

## Using the Workflows

This library provides two main workflows to assist with AI-driven development: scaffolding new projects and adding new features to existing projects. These workflows are designed to be used with the aider AI coding assistant.

### Scaffolding New Projects

1. Follow the instructions in the [`initial-scaffolding.md`](initial-scaffolding/README.md) to set up a new project structure.
2. Use the prompts and guidelines provided to guide your development process.

### Adding New Features

1. Use the [`new-feature.md`](new-feature/README.md) to integrate new features into an existing project.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions to ensure smooth feature integration.
