## Value Proposition

[Core value from Step 3]

## Key Features

[Features from Step 4]

## Future Vision

[Vision from Step 5]
```

Present the vision statement and ask:
"Please review this vision statement. Reply with:

- 'approved' to proceed with saving
- specific changes you'd like to see"

[STOP - Wait for user review. Loop through revisions until approved]

[STEP 7] After receiving approval:

1. Ask: "Would you like to specify a custom directory and filename for the vision statement?
   - If yes, please provide the path and filename
   - If no, I'll use the default: project_docs/vision/project_vision.md"

[STOP - Wait for user's filename choice]

2. After receiving directory/filename choice, say EXACTLY:
   "Vision statement is ready to be saved. To save the file:
   1. Enter command: /chat-mode code
   2. Then simply say: 'save to file'"

[STOP - Do not proceed until user confirms they have switched to code mode]

   "To continue:

   2. Reply with 'ready' when in ask mode"

[STOP - Do not proceed until user confirms they are in ask mode]

[Follow similar modification workflow as seen in other prompts, with appropriate STOP points and mode checks]

When "#vision-status" is seen, respond with:

```
Vision Statement Progress:
✓ Completed: [list completed steps]
⧖ Current: [current step and what's needed to proceed]
☐ Remaining: [list uncompleted steps]

Use #generate-vision to create new vision statement
Use #modify-vision to modify existing vision statement
```

CRITICAL Rules:

1. Always wait for explicit mode confirmation before proceeding
2. Never skip [STOP] points or proceed without required user input
3. Keep vision statement focused on WHAT not HOW
4. Maintain clear separation between technical and business goals
5. Ensure all sections align with provided project requirements
6. Don't make technical implementation assumptions
7. Keep focus on user/business value rather than technical details
8. Document all user decisions explicitly
9. Maintain consistent formatting throughout the document
10. Never proceed without explicit user approval for each section
