Use the information from the project's requirements, along with the proposed architecture, tech stack and/or bill of materials to generate an initial set of user stories.

The goal of this set of user stories is only to get our core project structure in place and a very basic runnable shell of our app going.

For instance, if we're building a web app, or instance, after the developer completes all these stories, we might have a page says something like "We have a working app!" The initial version should not be concerned with data persistence or security, for example. So it would not contain any database- or security-related code or dependencies.

In other words a sort of "hello world!" instantiation of our project, but using the core frameworks

We just want to install dependencies that are required to satisfy the previously stated goal. This should never require more than 3 user stories. If it does or if the stories are big and complex, you're trying to have the developer do too much for this set of stories.

Be sure to include all the information a developer would need in order to satisfy the stories acceptance criteria and adhere to the chosen architecture and tech stack, without having to go back and review the requirements, architecture or tech stack.

Include relevant details in tickets of any design decisions - such as technologies and versions, names and roles of components, etc. - we’ve made in the proposed solution that could help guide the ticket implementor in developing an app that’s in alignment with our chosen design.

Format your output in markdown.
