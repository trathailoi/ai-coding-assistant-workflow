I have an idea for a new feature of a legacy ruby on rails project, which is old and big. If I haven't already given my idea to you, ask me to provide it before proceeding.

Using my idea, generate a set of core requirements. Keep the requirements simple and focused on the aspects that are most likely to impact the feature.

Present the list of requirements in an organized manner. Categorize as appropriate. Give each core feature a unique number I can use later to refer back to that feature.
